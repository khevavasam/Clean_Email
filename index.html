        <h2>Delete All Emails to Tame Your Inbox</h2>
        <p>Every day, over 300 billion email messages are sent and received worldwide. Out of these, around 50 percent are spam. It’s no surprise many inboxes are cluttered, 
            leaving users wondering if it’s possible to delete all emails at once. The good news: it’s easy with the right tool.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to go nuclear on your inbox, though. You can also learn how to delete multiple emails, focusing on specific categories like promotions, newsletters, 
            or social media notifications. Whichever method you choose, it’s best to clean up your inbox soon, as hundreds of unwanted emails make it harder to focus on the important ones.</p>

                <h2>2. How to Delete All Emails on Gmail</h2>
                <p>Being the most popular email service in the world, Gmail is also the number one destination for spam messages. There are many Gmail users whose inboxes have accumulated so many unwanted messages that they’ve essentially become unusable.</p>
                <p>Luckily, learning how to delete all emails on Gmail is quick and easy:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log in to your Gmail account.</li>
                    <li>On the left side of your screen (if you are on desktop), select More.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>While knowing how to delete all Gmail emails at once is a good start, you can also go a step or two further by learning how to delete all promotions 
                    in Gmail and how to unsubscribe from emails that you no longer wish to keep receiving—even if they don’t contain an unsubscribe link or don’t honor unsubscribe requests.</p>
                <p>When you use a bulk email organization tool like Clean Email, it doesn’t matter how many messages you need to delete to achieve Inbox Zero, the state of your inbox 
                    when you have nothing in it that demands your attention, because the tool always does all the tedious, repetitive work for you.</p>

                    <h2>How to Delete All Emails - FAQs</h2>
                
                    <h3>Can you delete all emails at once?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, it’s easily possible to delete all emails at once, especially if you use a capable bulk email cleaner like Clean Email. With its help, you can not only get rid of all emails but also selectively delete messages of a certain type or from specific senders.</p>
                
                    <h3>How do I delete thousands of emails at once?</h3>
                    <p>Most email services let you delete only up to 50 or 100 messages at once. If you want to delete thousands of emails at once, then you should use a third-party bulk email cleaner like Clean Email, whose premium version lets you delete an unlimited number of messages.</p>
                
                    <h3>How can I delete all my emails in Gmail?</h3>
                    <p>If you want to delete all your Gmail emails and keep your mail address, you should consider using a third-party inbox cleaner. A good inbox cleaner can save you a ton of time, making it well worth its cost.</p>
                
                    <h3>How do I delete emails from a certain date?</h3>
                    <p>While some email services let you filter emails by date, others don’t. What’s more, the process isn’t always straightforward, so you’re better off using a third-party inbox organizer like Clean Email, whose intelligent filters and smart folders make deleting messages from a certain date a breeze.</p>
                
                    <h3>How do I delete all emails on my phone?</h3>
                    <p>Mobile email clients often lack important features, such as the ability to conveniently delete all emails at once. Fortunately, some inbox cleaners, such as Clean Email, can be downloaded from Google Play Store and Apple App Store, helping you delete as many emails as you need on any mobile device.</p>
                
                    <h3>How do I clear my email inbox quickly?</h3>
                    <p>Cleaning an inbox that has been neglected for years can take a lot of time, so you should look for tools that can speed up the process. Clean Email can turn even the messiest inbox into a shining example of email organization with just a few simple clicks.</p>
